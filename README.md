# Real Time Screen Translator (English to Chinese)

Screen Translator is a Python desktop tool for live translation of any text visible on your screen.  
It lets you draw a rectangle over part of your screen (e.g. a game, video, software UI), captures the text using OCR (Tesseract), and translates it into your target language (e.g. Chinese) in real time.

Ideal for:
- Playing games in English.
- Translating videos with subtitles.
- Translating software UIs or documents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Optional)

You can customize the translator's behavior by editing the `Config` class at the top of `screen-translator.py`:

```python
class Config:
    TESSERACT_CONFIG = '--psm 6'
    UPSCALE_FACTOR = 3
    SHARPNESS_FACTOR = 2.0
    BW_THRESHOLD = 200
    SOURCE_LANGUAGE = 'english'
    TARGET_LANGUAGE = 'chinese (simplified)'
```

- **`SOURCE_LANGUAGE`**: The language of the text on your screen.
- **`TARGET_LANGUAGE`**: The language you want to translate to.
- **`UPSCALE_FACTOR`**, **`SHARPNESS_FACTOR`**, **`BW_THRESHOLD`**: Image processing settings to improve OCR accuracy. You can experiment with these if the text is not being detected correctly.
